### About me
I have started learing to code over 6 years ago. I began with console scripts in C++, then I switched to Java. I was always interesed in mobile developement as apps are used by so many people all around the world on dail basics and can easily imporove quality and comfort of our lives. So I created a few apps for Android in Java. And then I fall in love with Kotlin + Android. Since then I am trying to master coding as much as possible and apply this knowdledge into my projects. However, the thing I love about programming is that it is never-ending learning process - new day, new thing to discover or upgrade. üòú

#### Hobbies
My personal idol is Elon Musk, so saying that I try to spend every waking hour productively should not be suprisingüòâ. I am into robotics and in my free time creating one, which will, who knows, maybe be on Mars one day. I used Python, C++ and C in this project. However, a man cannot live by work only - to achive work-life balance I often take bike rides. It allows me to chill out and lose some energy, which I have a lot üòÑ. My another passion is aviation - flying is great and becoming a personal pilot was one of my best decisions in life. ‚úàÔ∏è
