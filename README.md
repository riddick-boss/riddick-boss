# Paweł Kremienowski 👋

Programmer focused on developing Android apps with Kotlin language :sunglasses:

### About me
I began learning to code with console scripts in C++, then I switched to Java. I was always interesed in mobile developement as apps are used by so many people all around the world on dail basics and can easily imporove quality and comfort of our lives. So I created a few apps for Android in Java. After that, I fall in love with Kotlin + Android. Since then I am trying to master coding as much as possible and apply this knowledge into my projects. The thing I love about programming is that it is never-ending learning process - new day, new thing to discover or upgrade. 😜

### Tech stack:
- mainly Android, RxKotlin
- and some skills in: Fluter, Dart, Python

### Hobbies
I am into robotics and in my free time creating one, which will, hopefully, be on Mars one day. However, a man cannot live by work only - to achive work-life balance I often take bike rides. It allows me to chill out and lose some energy, which I have a lot 😄. My another passion is aviation - flying is great and becoming a personal pilot was one of my best decisions in life. ✈️
